#  Speech Recognition System
This repository contains the code and data for an assignment focused on speech recognition using the AudioMNIST dataset.

## Dataset
The data utilized in this assignment were sourced from the AudioMNIST dataset. This dataset comprises multiple recordings of male and female participants articulating the word "zero" across various age groups and environmental settings. Initially, the audio recordings were verified to have a sample rate of 44,100 Hz using Audacity software.

## Training and Testing Data
The dataset was split into training and testing sets. The training set consists of 20 recordings of males and 20 recordings of females pronouncing the word "zero," while a separate set of 10 recordings was designated for testing purposes.

## Data Analysis
During the training process, various analyses were conducted on the audio recordings, including:

Computation of mean energy for each gender.

Zero crossing rate (ZCR) analysis.

Power Spectral Density (PSD) and correlation coefficient computation.

## Classifications
The testing records were evaluated based on different criteria, including energy, zero crossing rate, correlation, and power spectral density. Additionally, classifications were made considering all these criteria.

## Enhancements
